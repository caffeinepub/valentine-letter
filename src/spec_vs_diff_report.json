  "summary": "The diff implements a single-page envelope-to-letter reveal UI with Tailwind-based Valentine styling and a cohesive rose/pink theme, but it appears to miss the exact envelope label text requirement and introduces unrequested Internet Identity/auth-related scaffolding plus an unrequested backend canister stub.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Envelope element label must be exactly “Click to Open 💌”.",
      "reason": "The envelope renders the emoji (💌) as a separate element and the text as “Click to Open” without including “💌” in the same label string.",
      "evidence": [
        "frontend/src/App.tsx"
      ]
    }

  "hallucinated_features": [
    {
      "description": "Internet Identity authentication/provider and identity-aware actor creation (auth scaffolding and react-query invalidation).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly lists Internet Identity authentication as a non-goal, yet the diff adds InternetIdentityProvider usage and associated hooks for login/identity/actor.",

    },
    {
      "description": "Backend canister stub added (empty actor).",
      "reason": "The request is frontend-only and does not mention adding or changing backend code; persistence is a non-goal.",
